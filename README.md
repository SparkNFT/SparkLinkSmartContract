# SparkLink Smart Contract

## Brief introduction

SparkLink Smart Contract is an Ethereum smart contract.
Authors can publish their virtual products (such as a book) on the blockchain and generate a `root NFT`.
Others can buy a child `NFT3` from any existing father `NFT2`, holder of `NFT2` will get income.
At the same time, holders of `NFT2`'s father `NFT3` will extract the amount corresponding to the proportion of royalties from the profit of the child `NFT2`.

SparkLink Smart Contract can support these features:

- Authors can create virtual products (such as a book) with attributes (such as: royalty percent, maximum number of child NFTs).
- Accept shill from an existing NFT and will get an child NFT.
- Claim the profit generated by the NFT you own.

For design details, please see [API document](doc/SparkLink_API.md).

## Getting Started

To install required node.js modules:

```bash
npm ci
```

To compile the solidity source code

```bash
make build
```

To run unit test:

```bash
make test
```

To deploy the smart contract on Ethereum rinkeby testnet:

```bash
make rinkeby
```

Note:

- This project is powered by [hardhat](https://hardhat.org/).
  You can change your network configuration in `hardhat.config.ts` file.
- Before you deploy a smart contract or interact with a smart contract,
  you need to set up your wallet private key and [`infura`](https://infura.io/) key in `config.json`.

  `config.json` is a template, which contains dummy configurations.

  Please handle your private key carefully. In this project,
  `config.json` has already been added into `.gitignore`, as foolproof.
