Besides, `SparkNFT Smart Contract` is also a special ERC-721 NFT (attached a tree data structure).

- Therefore, it supports NFT-721 interfaces, like `ownerOf`, `balanceOf`.
- Since it is special, theÂ behavior of `mint` is very different from common ERC-721 NFT.
  There are two methods to mint a new NFT.
  When publisher `publish` an issue (represent an series of NFTs), contract will generate a root NFT and transfer it to him.
  Then other buyer can using `acceptShill` with a NFT ID mint a NFT which is a child NFT of the NFT ID it used.
  In the second progress, buyer need pay for this NFT's price to the owner of the NFT ID he inputs.
  And when some one mint NFT from new this NFT, the owner of its father NFT will get part of amount it sells. 
- There are some slight differences at the behavior of `token transfer` function.
  This token is integrated a price mechanism, if token's price is determined by owner, `transfer` function will check if the value of this transaction is equal price.
